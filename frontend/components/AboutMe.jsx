        <p>Hi! My name is Nicole, and I am a software developer in New York.</p><br/>
        <p>As an animal lover, I have always wanted to build a pet-focused project.
        I decided to use the popular website Etsy as inspiration for this single-page app for adoptable pets.
        I utilized the Petfinder API to populate Petsy with real adoptable pets in Manhattan, and stored images
        on AWS to allow for scalability. Petsy is a RESTful API built on a Rails backend, along with React on
        the front end to provide seamless rendering of the siteâ€™s components.</p><br/>
        <p>If you would like to see more of my work, view my resume, or would like my contact information, please visit my <a href="http://www.nicole-tibaldi.me" className="about-me-link">portfolio site</a>.</p>
